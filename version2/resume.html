		<h4 class="header_underline">Objective:</h4>
		<p>I am in search of a front-end web developer position in the Seattle/Bellevue area that utilizes my skillset in modern web technologies, including HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, WordPress, and more. I hope to find a position with a company that I can grow with over the long-term.</p>

		<h4 class="header_underline">Summary:</h4>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Skillset lies in front-end web development. Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JSON, JavaScript, SQL, WordPress, SEO and technical writing.</strong></li>
			<li>Translating designs into functional applications</li>
			<li>Have held a senior or lead title with multiple companies and am an excellent team member.</li>
			<li>Enthusiastic about my work and take great pride in what I do.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4 class="header_underline">Skills:</h4>
		
		<strong>HTML5</strong> &ndash; I focus on writing clean, semantic markup that is cross browser and platform compatible. My code is responsive, follows rules of progressive enhancive and is optimized for search engine placement.
		
		<p><strong>CSS3</strong> &ndash; All style elements on my sites are handled with CSS. I keep my HTML to a minimum and use CSS as much as possible. This is definitely my favorite language to write.</p>
		
		<p><strong>jQuery</strong> &ndash; This is my favorite way to add dynamic functionality to my sites. I love the syntax of jQuery and the compatibility it has with various platforms, devices, and browsers.</p>

		<p><strong>WordPress</strong> &ndash; I have a great appreciation for this platform and using it as a CMS. My WordPress experience includes creating custom themes, plus some widgets and plugins.</p>
		
		<p><strong>JSON</strong> &ndash; I started writing JSON in 2011 and quickly grew an appreciation for its capabilities in storing and transferring data. Most of my experience with JSON comes from developing mobile applications where data needs to be sent to an objective–c script and converted to a dictionary.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Javascript</strong> &ndash; I have an intermediate skill set writing JavaScript but am always looking to improve my knowledge and understanding of this language. Although I tend to work more in JavaScript frameworks than the core language, I am comfortable with its syntax and enjoy working with it.</p>
		
		<p><strong>PHP</strong> &ndash; Definitely my favorite tool for working on the back–end of my sites. Most of my experience with PHP has been in creating logins, authenticating users, and validating forms. I am also interested in working with PHP frameworks such as CakePHP.</p>
		
		<p><strong>SQL</strong> &ndash; Learning SQL has allowed me to build dynamic applications both with MySQL and SQLite.</p>
		
		<p><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> &ndash; My SEO experience includes working with clients on developing pay–per–click campaigns, generating keywords, and writing valid, semantic HTML that is search engine friendly. I created an SEO website with a series of articles that would showcase not only my knowledge on this topic, but also my abilities as a technical writer. <a href="http://pellegriniportfolio.com/seo/" target="_blank">Please visit my SEO website at: http://pellegriniportfolio.com/seo/</a></p>
