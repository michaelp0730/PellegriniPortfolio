	<img src="img/family_pic.jpg" width="250" height="188" alt="" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 5px 10px; border:2px solid #999;" />I've been studying web design and development since the turn of the century. I vividly remember watching a friend of mine who was studying at the Art Insitute of Seattle build a project in Flash and thinking, &quot;I could totally do this!&quot; At the time I had just started my sophmore year at the University of Washington and had no idea what I wanted to major in or do for a career. Unfortunately web development was too new to study at UW, so within a few months I had left the university and enrolled at a local community college to study web design and multimedia. A couple years later I graduated on the dean's list with my associates degree. I thought about going back to the University of Washington at that time but still wasn't sure what I'd want to study, so I started working in my field instead.
	<p>I spent a few years building websites for a company called Business Marketing Services and then branched out on my own as a freelance developer in 2008. I did contract work for a few different companies and managed my own business. After my wife and I got married and moved from Seattle to San Diego in 2010, I decided to start thinking about going back to a full&ndash;time job working for a company, and finishing off my bachelor's degree. Ironically, the day that I found out I had been accepted to attend school at Colorado Tech University Online was the same day that I was contacted by Scrollmotion, a company who builds mobile applications for iPad, iPhone and Android, to join them as a Production Developer. Three months later I was promoted to Senior Production Developer, but I never went back on my decision to go back to school.</p>
	<p>In addition to going back to school and starting a new job, my wife and I had our first child, a daughter named Ava Simone Pellegrini. She is absolutely amazing and brought so much love and happiness to our entire family. The next couple years will be very busy for me but it's quite worth it. The good news for me is that by the time Ava turns 3 I'll have my bachelors degree in Information Technology emphasizing on Application Programming, with a completely new skillset to compliment my abilities as a web developer.</p>
