		<h4>About Me</h4>
		<p>I'm a Web Development Engineer at Amazon.com in Seattle. I've been studying and working in web development for over 6 years, and love what I do. I write semantic HTML, expressive CSS, and modular JavaScript. I'm married with two amazing little girls and a son on the way. I have a Bachelor's degree in Information Technology with a concentration on Application Programming, and an Associate's degree in Web Design and Multimedia. In my free time I love to play guitar, cook, read biographies, and watch sports.</p>
