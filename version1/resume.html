    	<h2>Profile</h2>
        <div class="content">
        <p>I have been designing and developing websites for nearly ten years now. I graduated on the Dean’s list with a degree in Web Design &amp; Multimedia in 2004 and started my professional career in January of 2005. I am passionate about web design and development, and am constantly challenging myself to learn new technologies. My goal with every site I build is to write the cleanest, most efficient markup possible, use CSS to handle all design elements of the page, then add interactivity and dynamic elements with jQuery, Javascript, and PHP. Every site is built with optimal search engine placement and progressive enhancement in mind.</p>
        </div>
        
        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <div class="content">
        <p><strong>HTML</strong> &ndash; XHTML, HTML 4, HTML5 &ndash; I focus on writing clean, semantic markup that is cross browser and platform compatible. My code is responsive, follows rules of progressive enhansive and is optimized for search engine placement.</p>
        <p><strong>CSS</strong> &ndash; CSS 2 &amp; 3 &ndash; All style elements on my sites are handled with CSS. I keep my HTML to a minimum and use CSS as much as possible. This is definitely my favorite language to write.</p> 
        <p><strong>jQuery</strong> &ndash; this is my favorite way to add dynamic funactionality to my sites. I love the syntax of jQuery and the compatibility it has with all the various platforms and browsers out there. Whether I need to do something as simple as pre&ndash;load images or develop custom animations, jQuery is my go&ndash;to every time.</p> 
        <p><strong>Javascript</strong> &ndash; The more jQuery I write, the more interest I have in JavaScript. The sytax may not be as straight forward as jQuery but I have immense respect for the capabilites of this language and am constantly challenging myself to learning more about JavaScript and implement it into my work.</p>
        <p><strong>PHP/MYSQL</strong> &ndash; Definitely my favorite tools for working on the back&ndash;end of my sites. Most of my experience with PHP has been in creating logins, authenticating users, and validating forms. I love the relationship between PHP and MYSQL and am currently studying these two technologies extensively.</p>
        <p><strong>XML/XSLT</strong> &ndash; I mostly use XML and XSLT for creating RSS feeds for different sites that I build and maintain. I love the versatility of XML and the relative ease of using XSLT to transform data from XML documents into valid HTML.</p>  
        <p><strong>Search Engine Optimization</strong> &ndash; I've spent years working with clients on developing SEO campaigns and pay&ndash;per&ndash;click campaigns, generating keywords, and writing valid, semantic HTML that is search engine friendly. After gaining so much valuable knowledge and experience in this field I decided to create my own SEO website with a series of articles that would showcase not only my knowledge on this topic, but also my abilities as a technical writer. <a href="http://www.pellegrinipage.com/portfolio/seo" target="_new">Please visit my SEO site by clicking here.</a></p> 
        <p><strong>Progressive Enhancement</strong> &ndash; After reading a few books and articles on progressive enhancement I was hooked on the idea of building sites from the ground up that catered to the lowest common denominator in terms of platforms and browsers, and then built upwards in terms of functionality. As we continue to browse the web on new devices I think an understanding of progressive enhancement is an absolute necessity for the modern web developer. This concept has definitely changed the way I build sites.</p>
