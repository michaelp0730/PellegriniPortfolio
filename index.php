      <p>This is a blog site I created for my family. Since my wife and I have relatives all over the country, we thought it would be nice to have a site that kept everyone up to date with what's happening in our lives. The site is built on the WordPress framework but the theme is totally custom. I did all of the design and development work, which is based on HTML5, CSS3, jQuery, JavaScript, and PHP.</p>

      <h3>Pulpcore</h3>

      <p>This site was designed for San Diego ‘Pulpcore’ artist David Russell Talbott. David was looking for a new website with a modern feel that would do his artwork justice. The idea was to give the site a dark, sinister vibe that was easy to read and navigate, but wouldn’t distract the visitor from his pieces.</p>
      <p>All design elements were handled with CSS, keeping the HTML clean and efficient. The image scroller on the home page was done with jQuery.</p>

      <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>

      <p>This is a website that I've been wanting to do for quite a while. While working at Business Marketing Services in Seattle I did extensive research on Search Engine Optimization. In addition to building websites for our clients, we offered SEO services to help get their sites to the top of the search engine listings. One of my duties as lead web developer was to optimize our client's existing sites as well as build new sites with optimal search engine ranking in mind.</p>
      <p>After several years working on SEO related projects, I felt it was time to put together my own series of articles outlining the steps towards creating a successful SEO campaign. I feel that this site not only showcases my abilities in building a business oriented website, but also my skills as a technical writer and SEO specialist.</p>

      <p>I created this site for a local Mexican restaurant located in Des Moines, WA. Arturo wanted a site that would showcase not only his business, but the culture that his business is based on. By utilizing modern web development tools and practices, I was able to achieve this goal and create another happy client.</p>

      <p>I designed and developed this site for Las Vegas handyman and general contractor, Hardy Niggemeier. Hardy wanted a site that would showcase his various projects to potential clients, and help him find new clients based on a professional web presence.</p>
      <p>The main technologies used in this site were XHTML, CSS, and jQuery, keeping it clean, semantic, and cross platform compatible.</p>

      <h3>Sidecar</h3>
      <a href="http://www.pellegrinipage.com/portfolio/sidecar/" target="_blank"><img src="img/sidecar_screenshot.png" width="250" height="238" alt="" class="photo-right"></a>
      <p>Sidecar is a website I designed to showcase a restaurant concept that I've been building in my head for years. It started with the logo you see on the right and turned into a complete vision. Although it's doubtful that Sidecar will ever actually become a real restaurant, it was a fun project to develop.</p>
      <p>The site is full of high resolution graphics and lots of jQuery bells and whistles. It was definitely not meant to be bandwidth friendly but I must admit that there is a certain sense of freedom that comes with including a 400k graphic on your site just because it looks cool! I hope you like it.</p>
